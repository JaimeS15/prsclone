# PSRC Trajectory Data

This repo contains PSRC trajectory data from 2019 (contained in `trace_data` folder). This data can be joined to the 2019 PSRC household travel survey trips dataset by the "recid" column. There may be some slight inconsistencies between the two, as the trajectory data is not as processed as the HTS.
